File for arduino (need Arduino software)
	\Arduino\Arduino.ini

File to run on windows*
	\<name>\bin\Debug\<name>.exe

File to open and edit (need visual studio)
	<name>.sln	([opt:]ctrl+alt+L [and then] controll all - control all.vb[double click on this])





*The <name>.exe might also be in the same folder as this file. Also I can't afford paying Windows to have an 'checked and virus free program' so windows will display a warning, if you don't believe in me feel free to not use it, but the source code is in the folder and you can check the code yourself if you want. I have NOT put a virus in it.
Also the folder name is problatly 'Controll All' and wrong, sorry but I VB doesn't allow me to change that name
